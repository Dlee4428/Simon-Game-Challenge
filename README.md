 Simon Game is based on jQuery Javascript Web Game
 
 Game rules

1. At the start, Simon's game will randomly give you a signal ( one color will pop up).
2. You have to repeat the signal by pressing the same color. 
3. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add a random one. 
4. You need to repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in the order.
5. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.
6. You need to repeat these three signals in the order.
7. Simon will repeat all three signals and add one.
8. Continue playing as long as you can repeat the sequence.
9. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon will automatically speed up. That means you need to add Skill levels.
10. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more then 5 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "REZZ" sound.  That means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends. GAME OVER.
11. If you manage to repeat of sequences for skill levels 1, 2, 3,  or 4 and Simon will salute you with six short signals from the last lens you pressed.
